Python Oddities Explained
=========================

Description
-----------

A number of Python features often seem counter-intuitive at first glance, especially when moving from another programming language to Python. Often what at first seems like a bug, will later reveal itself to be a misunderstood feature.

During this talk we'll look at a number of Python's unique features and quirks and attempt to re-shape our mental models of Python to better match reality. By the end of this talk you'll have a deeper understanding of Python's rules behind objects, scope, and variables.

Warning: this talk will include many Python head scratchers so show up prepared to think on your feet!


Audience
--------

This talk is aimed at curious Python programmers who want to know about Python's quirks. Even experienced Python programmers should learn something from this talk.

The audience is expected to already have an understanding of Python's core data types and programming constructs (lists, functions, variables, etc.) Audience members will come out of this talk with a better appreciation for less obvious Python features and edge cases to watch out for.

Additional Notes
----------------

I spent 2016 tweeting Python oddities. Every week I tweeted at least one Python oddity using the hashtag #pythonoddity. I got a lot of feedback on many of these oddities/gotchas and in this talk I hope to showcase the most interesting and most educational ones.

I do on-site corporate training for Python and Django teams as my day job. I also teach Python in free webcasts every week, I mentor folks at my local Python study group on a weekly basis, and I tweet about Python a lot.

I spoke at 8 Python and Django conferences in 2016 and 2017. This talk is a new one, but it's based on a workshop I give for my clients which is based on the many #pythonoddity tweets that I've been making since January 2016.
