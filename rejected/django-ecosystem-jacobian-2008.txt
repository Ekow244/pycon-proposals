Summary
=======

The past year has seen a real explosion of neat tools built with Django.
There's a newfound maturity among these third-party additions to Django.
This session presents some highlights of the Django ecosystem. We'll look at
micro-frameworks for things like tagging, voting, and OpenID integration and
also larger projects that turn Django into a web shop or a GIS server.

Intended audience
=================

Django users, primarily, but anyone interested in what's going on in the
Django ecosystem should find the talk interesting. Some of tool I'll present
have parts generally useful outside of Django (GeoDjango_ and Typogrify_)
and/or allow better integration with other Python libraries (Tranquil_).

Outline
=======

I'll cover around around eight projects in a 30 minute session, or twelve in
a 45 minute session, with a bit of sample code and a demo for each. There's
a lot of development happing around Django right now, so it's hard to predict
what the most interesting projects will be four months from now. Below is a list
of projects I'd present today, but the final list may (and likely will) change 
between now and PyCon.

    * Django-atompub_: adds improved support for Atom syndication (RFC 4287)
      and preliminary support for the Atom Publishing Protocol (RFC 5023).
    
    * Django-evolution_: one implementation (deseb_ is another) of schema
      evolution (a.k.a "migrations") for Django.
    
    * Django-openid_: lets your Django application act as an OpenID
      consumer. That is, this allows users to log in and/or register with
      your site using OpenID.
    
    * Django-registration_: a few pre-built views to allow account
      registration and basic password management.
    
    * Django-rest-interface_: a set of tools for quickly adding REST APIs on
      top of your models. One of Django's 2007 Summer of Code projects.
    
    * Django-tagging_: adds tagging to your models.
    
    * Django-values_: add user-editable settings/properties to a Django site's admin
      screens.
    
    * Django-voting_: adds simple thumbs-up/thumbs-down voting. Think Digg or Reddit.
    
    * GeoDjango_: GIS support for Django. Used in conjunction with Oracle or PostGIS this
      gets you a full-featured GIS stack on top of Django.
      
    * `Review Board`_: a nifty code review tool built with Django.
    
    * Satchmo_: a web shop built on top of Django. Usable without any code modifications,
      but also a good starting point for writing custom stores.
    
    * Tranquil_: use Django and SQLAlchemy together smoothly.
    
    * Typogrify_: good typography in your templates.

Notes for reviewers
===================

I've indicated that I'd prefer a 45 minute session, but really I'm happy
with either. I'll simply cover few projects in a shorter session.
