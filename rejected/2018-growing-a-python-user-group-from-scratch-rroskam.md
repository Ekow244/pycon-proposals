Title: Growing a Python User Group from Scratch (Robert Roskam)

Category: Education Summit

Duration: 30 min (I think)

Description:
In December of 2015, I was talking with a co-worker and said, "Hey, have you noticed that there's no Python User Group not just in our city; there's none in the whole state." So after briefly discussing it with him, we started a user group, promoted it, got it listed on python.org (thanks Chris Angelico!) and have kept it going ever since.

I'd like to recap our victories and more importantly our mistakes in learning what makes for a good user group, what to talk about, and how to keep going-- even when no one shows up.

Additional notes
This is closer to auto-biographical thing; I did and I've never given a talk about it. I have no particular materials for it yet.
