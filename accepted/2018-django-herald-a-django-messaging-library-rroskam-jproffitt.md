Category: Poster Talk
Speakers: Robert Roskam and Jared Proffitt

Description
A Django messaging library that features:
Class-based declaration and registry approach, like Django Admin
Supports multiple transmission methods (Email, SMS, Slack, etc) per message
Browser-based previewing of messages
Maintains a history of messaging sending attempts and can view these messages
Disabling notifications per user

Additional notes
Never presented this topic before. I'm a maintainer for this library. Here's the repo: https://github.com/worthwhile/django-herald 

No need for any power. I have no accessibility needs.
