# PyCon proposals

A collection of old proposals for PyCon - both accepted and rejected. PyCon makes parts of the accepted proposals available via the [list of talks](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/talks/), but not all information is included, and it's also instructive to see proposals that were rejected.

### Propose!
You should submit a proposal to PyCon 2015 before September 15th, 2014.  The PyCon committee has also put together some great resources: https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal-resources/

### Contribute
If you have proposed to PyCon in the past and are willing to contribute your proposals, please open a pull request!

Format:
- Name
- Year
- Outcome
- Link to video, if accepted
- Feedback from the committee, if any
- Actual proposal
